# Basic Card Counting Strategy in Blackjack (Hi-Lo System)

The Hi-Lo system is the most popular and beginner-friendly card counting method. Here's how it works:

---

## 1. **Assign Values to Cards**
- **+1** for low cards: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- **0** for neutral cards: 7, 8, 9
- **-1** for high cards: 10, J, Q, K, A

---

## 2. **Keep a Running Count**
- Start with a count of **0** at the beginning of the shoe (deck).
- As cards are dealt, add or subtract the corresponding value (+1, 0, or -1) to the running count.
- **Example**: If the cards dealt are 5, K, 7, 2, the running count would be:
  +1 (for the 5) -1 (for the K) +0 (for the 7) +1 (for the 2) = **+1**.

---

## 3. **Calculate the True Count (for Multi-Deck Games)**
- Divide the running count by the estimated number of decks remaining in the shoe.
- **Example**: If the running count is +6 and there are approximately 3 decks left, the true count is **+2** (6 ÷ 3 = 2).

---

## 4. **Adjust Your Bets and Strategy**
- A **higher true count** (positive number) means there are more high cards (10s, face cards, and Aces) left in the deck, which favors the player. In this case:
  - Increase your bets.
  - Follow basic strategy more aggressively (e.g., double down or split more often).
- A **lower true count** (negative number) means there are more low cards left, which favors the dealer. In this case:
  - Bet the minimum.
  - Play more conservatively.

---

## Why It Works
- High cards benefit the player because they increase the chances of getting a natural blackjack (which pays 3:2) and improve the odds of the dealer busting.
- Low cards benefit the dealer because they make it easier for the dealer to make strong hands (like 17–21) without busting.

## Important Notes
- Card counting is **not illegal**, but casinos may ask you to leave if they suspect you’re counting cards.
- The Hi-Lo system is just the foundation. More advanced systems (like Omega II or Wong Halves) offer greater accuracy but are more complex.
- Practice is key! Use drills or apps to get comfortable with keeping the count quickly and accurately.

## Example Betting Strategy
- Minimum bet: $10

- True Count = +1: Bet $20

- True Count = +2: Bet $40

- True Count = +3: Bet $80

- True Count = +4 or higher: Bet $100+

By mastering the Hi-Lo system, you can gain a slight edge over the casino in Blackjack.
