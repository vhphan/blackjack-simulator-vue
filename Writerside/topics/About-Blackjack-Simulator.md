# About Blackjack Simulator

## Overview
In this project, we will build a simple blackjack simulator that:
 - Simulate a Blackjack Card Counting System. The system will use the Hi-Lo method, the most basic card counting strategy for beginners.
 - Allow players to practice their card counting skills in a simulated environment. The simulator will show the recommended moves based on the current count and the player's hand.
